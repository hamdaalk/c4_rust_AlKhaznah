# C2Rust Compiler

C2Rust is a simple compiler and virtual machine for a subset of the C programming language. It supports integer and floating-point arithmetic, basic control structures, and function calls. The project is inspired by the original [C4 compiler](https://github.com/rswier/c4).

## Features
- Tokenizer and parser for a subset of C.
- Virtual machine with support for integer and floating-point operations.
- Basic standard library functions like `printf`, `malloc`, and `exit`.
